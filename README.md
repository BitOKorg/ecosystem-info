  {
    "name": "CHIPS (CHIPS)",
    "description": "On the CHIPS blockchain, users play Pangea Poker - a decentralized, trustless poker game.",
    "categories": [
      "smartChains",
      "gaming"
    ],

Use the above format while submitting an addition. We need the logo in both png and webp formats. Each with height set to `70px`. We recommend the https://squoosh.app/ to resize and convert the images. Don't worry if you are unsure how to submit the image. Give us a link along with the Pull Request and we will take care of it.
